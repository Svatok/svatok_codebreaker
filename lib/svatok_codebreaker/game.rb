tries to break a secret code created by a computer. The
code-maker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re
going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers
between 1 and 6.
 '
      about_game[:rules] = '  Computer creates a secret code of four numbers between 1
and 6. You get ' + ATTEMPTS.to_s + ' chances to break the code.
In each turn, you make a guess of four numbers. Computer
then marks the guess with up to four + and - signs.
  A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess
is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and
in the same position.
  A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess
is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a
different position.
  At any time during a game, you can request a hint, at which
point the system reveals one of the numbers in the
secret code. After the game is won or lost, you can opt
to save information about the game.
